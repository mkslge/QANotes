*Mock Questions*

***What is the importance of QAE?***

    -Quality Assurance Engineering is crucial to ensuring that 
    products meet customer expectations not only functionally, 
    but also in terms of performance, security, and usability. 
    QAEs play a proactive role in designing and implementing 
    automated test suites, identifying potential issues early in 
    the development cycle, and continuously improving quality 
    processes. At a company like Amazon, QAEs are key to 
    delivering reliable, scalable, and customer-focused solutions 
    at scale.


***Describe STLC***

    -The Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) is a structured 
    process that ensures systematic and thorough testing of 
    software. It begins with Requirement Analysis, where QA 
    identifies testable requirements. Next is Test Planning, 
    which defines the scope, objectives, schedule, resources, and
    risk strategy. Then comes Test Case Development, where test
    scenarios and scripts—manual or automated—are designed 
    based on the requirements. In Environment Setup, the 
    testing infrastructure, test data, and necessary 
    configurations are prepared. Test Execution follows, where
    planned test cases are run and defects are logged. Finally,
    Test Cycle Closure involves analyzing test 
    results, creating summary reports, and identifying lessons
    to improve future cycles. At Amazon’s scale, automation 
    and fast feedback loops are critical at every phase.

     


***Describe Defect Lifecycle***

    -The defect life cycle starts when a tester finds a bug and 
    logs it in a tracking tool like Jira. The defect is initially
    marked as New, then reviewed and Assigned to a developer. If
    valid, it’s moved to Open or In Progress. If not valid, it
    may be marked Rejected, Duplicate, or Deferred. After the
    developer fixes the issue, the status changes to Fixed,
    and it's sent back to QA for retesting. If the test
    passes, the defect is Verified and then Closed. If it
    fails, it's Reopened and the cycle continues.
    Throughout the process, defects are prioritized using
    severity and priority levels to ensure the most
    critical issues are addressed first.
